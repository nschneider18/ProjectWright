# ProjectWright

I created this project as a way to implement common data structures and 
algorithms in a few different programming languages to emphasize the 
differences in the way languages behave. The0 main structures I want to tackle 
over the next few months are linked lists, arraylists, binary trees, and red
black trees, The algorithms I want to implement are bubble sort, quick sort,
heap sort, merge sort, selection sort, and Dijkstra's algorithm. The langauges 
I am going to focus on are Java, C, C++, Rust, Python, Ruby, and Erlang.
